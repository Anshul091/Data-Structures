# Treaps

The code can be easily run using the terminal in Ubuntu, or using any IDE like VS Code.
Firstly one needs to input the first element of treap, to form the root and beginning of the tree. Further you have choice as to which function you want to implement.
Treap is a randomised binary search tree which follows the property of both heap and bst.
You select-
1 for inserting a new element in the Treap.
2 for searching an element in the Treap.
3 for deleting an element from the Treap.
4 for splitting the treap across an element (called pivot).
5 for inorder traversal.
6 for merging the splitted two treaps.
